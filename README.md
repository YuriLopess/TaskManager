<h1>Task Manager</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>

This project is a task management API, developed with the goal of practicing unit testing. Throughout the development process, I applied TDD (Test-Driven Development) principles, followed the AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern, and focused on using clear and meaningful test naming conventions. The main objective was to strengthen the practice of writing clean, objective, and maintainable tests.
